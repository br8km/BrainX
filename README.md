General Artificial Intelligence which Mimic Human Brains

---
How it works
1. Given a stimulate with text, image, audio clips, etc.
2. A random block of neurons will activate to mimic that stimulate
3. Study with fine grained adjustment
4. Response to that stimulate if it required

Features
- Low consumption
- High performance
- High efficiency
- Accurate understanding
- Parallel learning
- Long-short term momery
- Logical analysis
- Autonomous drive

---
Motive
- More accurate understanding of incoming information
- Less memory storage
- Higher speed of response time

---
Permissions
- NO actual actions to the real world
- NO `BAD` suggest response to any input

---
Theory
- Neurons can build connections with other neurons around
- Neurons can deliver transmiters
- Neurons can fire pulse voltage
